## Midterm Lab Task 2 -  Data Cleaning and Preparation using POWER QUERY
* Task Description:
Company X wants to clean and analyze job posting data from the Uncleaned_DS_Jobs.csv dataset (from Kaggle). The goal is to answer these questions:

1. Which job roles pay the most and least?
2. Which company sizes pay the best?
3. Where do specific job roles or titles pay the best and worst in a particular state?
   
# Steps Performed in Data Cleaning and Transformation:
* <ins>Clean Salary Estimate Column:

else if Text.Contains([Job Title], "Data Analyst") then  
"Data Analyst" 
else if Text.Contains([Job Title], "Data Engineer") then  
"Data Engineer"
else if Text.Contains([Job Title], "Machine Learning") then  
"Machine Learning Engineer" 
else  
"other" 
```
* <ins>Fix Location Column:
> <sup>Correct the Location column by replacing city names with state abbreviations (e.g., "California" to ", CA").\
> Use Custom Column to replace city names, then split the column.
