## Midterm Lab Task 3. Creating PIVOT TABLE and DASHBOARD
* Using the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the transform tables 
> Sal By Role, Sal By State, Sal by Size 

# Design your DASHBOARD that would highlight the ff: a. State with the most Number of Data Science 
> b. Job Role with the Highest Average Salary (Complete the dashboard as shown below) 
> c. Which Company Size pays the Highest(Complete the dashboard as shown below)  
> d. Which Sector Employs the Lowest and Highest Data Science related Jobs  
> e. Which Sector has the Minimum Average Salary and Maximum average Salary  
> i. Note, you need to create another query to create a PIVOT Table for d and e 
# Normalization


* Performed 1NF
* Perform Table split using 2NF
* Perform 3 NF
* Mapped the Normalized tables as a Physical Data Model

* For this task we are given a Flat data from Excel (See rawfile) and we are Task to perform 
* Data Cleaning and Preparation 

# Data Cleaning process
* Load the raw file
* Fit Column and row width and height
* TRIM extra spaces
* Remove NULL values
* Remove Duplicates
