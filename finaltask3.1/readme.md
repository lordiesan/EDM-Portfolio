## FinalTask 3.1: Using MYSQL Clause
1. Create a database named online_courseDB
2. Use the online_courseDB
3. Copy and paste the initial query then perform the SELECT statements required for each
problems in the figure below: (download onlineCourse.sql file)

* The following are already implemented: 
* A table named courses with the following fields: 
> id: Unique integer, auto-increment, primary key. 
course_name: String (VARCHAR), not null. 
category: String (VARCHAR), not null. 
enrollment_limit: Integer, not null. 
students_enrolled: Integer, not null. 
20 courses are already present. 
## The following are the tasks that need to be implemented using MySQL statements. Make sure to complete them in the order specified: 
# Task 1: Retrieve all courses where students_enrolled is less than the enrollment_limit. 
> ![Sample Output](IMAGE/task%203.1/task%201.PNG)
# Task 2: Group courses by category and calculate the total number of students enrolled for each category. 
> ![Sample Output](IMAGE/task%203.1/task2.PNG)
# Task 3: Retrieve the courses that are fully enrolled (i.e., students_enrolled equals enrollment_limit). 
> ![Sample Output](IMAGE/task%203.1/task3.PNG)
# Task 4: Calculate the total number of students enrolled across all courses. 
> ![Sample Output](IMAGE/task%203.1/task4.PNG)
# Task 5: Sort courses by students_enrolled in ascending order.
